    description: "Here’s a classic egg technique every home cook should master: how to make an omelette! This here is one of the first things Alex and I learned to cook from Julia Child. We started watching her in black and white when we first learned to cook. Julia was the perfect teacher for two new cooks, encouraging us that anyone could cook an omelette if we had the “courage of our convictions.” And this recipe? It makes for the most delicious omelette you’ve ever had: classic French style, with a golden exterior, soft interior, and loads of savory flavor. Here’s our adaptation of Julia’s classic technique, and it really does make the best omelette recipe imaginable.",

    name: "Quick Breakfast Quesadilla",
    description: "Here’s a recipe with breakfast in the title…that we almost always eat for lunch or dinner. Try this tasty Breakfast Quesadilla! The mighty breakfast quesadilla is in no way an authentic Mexican recipe. It’s solidly American-style, and the only thing that earns its title is that it’s filled with scrambled eggs. But wow, is it satisfying! Scrambled eggs, black beans and melty cheddar cheese sandwiched between toasted tortillas and dipped into in guacamole? It’s basic in all the right ways, and at the same time a revelation in each bite. We simply couldn’t stop eating it!",
